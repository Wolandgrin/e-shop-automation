**This is a test automation tool to automate following screnario:**
1. Go to any e-shop;
2. Navigate to some category 
3. Add two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category

To launch scenario execution properly right-click on "launch_e-shop.ps1" and choose - Execute with PowerShell 

Note: I tried to create this project completely independent and looking as a real automation project. Unfortunately due to lack of time not everything was implemented properly and instead of properly structured project I have all implementations in 1 file only
